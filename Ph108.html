    <h1>Welcome to PH 108: Electricity and Magnetism</h1>
    <p>This is a compulsory course for undergraduate freshers at IITB during their second semester. The recommended course textbook is Introduction to Electrodynamics by DJ Griffiths. If you've reached this page then you're probably in my tutorial batch. Tutorials will be conducted on Wednesdays and will involve me going over the solutions to some problems from that week's tutorial. It is recommended to attend the tutorial or atleast go over the solution for doing well in this course. I will be uploading the solutions to the tutorials on this page as soon after the tutorial as I can. All the best!</p>
