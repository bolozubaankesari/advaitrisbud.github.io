Hello! My name is Advait Risbud(I know it sounds like a fake name but it's not) and I am a first year undergraduate student at IIT Bombay in the Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science. I enjoy Physics, Comedy, and Music in no particular order. 

Welcome to my website. Here I will post some stuff about the courses I am taking along with a mix veg tandoori kebab platter of stupidity.
