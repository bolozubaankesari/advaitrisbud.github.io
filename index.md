Hey there! Welcome to my website. My name is Advait Risbud and I am an undergraduate in the Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science at IIT Bombay. I enjoy Physics, Math and jokes...I love jokes. On my website you can find information about courses I have taken, notes, projects, and some things that interest me.
